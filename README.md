### Oi, I'm Blenda 👩🏻‍💻💪🐈‍⬛🪐🌖

I’m a graduate student in applied computing and an astronomy lover. My current research combines Machine Learning and Gravitational Waves simulation. I'm also working as Educational Consult.  

Besides that I have the goal to explorer 🔭 and create 💻 Data Science Projects. 

Here you will find projects that are related to astronomy and a lot of Python 🐍.
